This response provides a skeletal structure and crucial code snippets to guide you in building the "Web Scraper Pro" project. Due to the complexity and length of a full, production-ready web scraper with all the features requested, providing the entire codebase here is impractical.  This response will focus on core components and demonstrate how they integrate.  You will need to expand upon these foundations.

**Project Structure:**

```
lusules-web-scraper-pro/
├── examples/
│   └── sample_output.json
├── scraper.py
├── config.yaml
├── proxies.py
├── anti_detection.py
├── data_extraction.py
├── output_manager.py
├── utils.py  # Helper functions
└── README.md
```

**1. `examples/sample_output.json`:**

This file will contain sample output generated by the scraper.  The structure depends entirely on the website being scraped.  Here's an example:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Example Product 1",
    "price": "$29.99",
    "description": "This is a sample product description.",
    "url": "https://example.com/product1"
  },
  {
    "title": "Example Product 2",
    "price": "$49.99",
    "description": "Another sample product description.",
    "url": "https://example.com/product2"
  }
]
```

**2. `scraper.py` (Main Scraper Logic):**

```python
import logging
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import yaml
from proxies import ProxyManager
from anti_detection import AntiDetection
from data_extraction import extract_data
from output_manager import OutputManager
from utils import random_delay


# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def scrape_website(config):
    """Main scraping function."""
    try:
        proxy_manager = ProxyManager(config['proxies'])
        anti_detection = AntiDetection(config)
        output_manager = OutputManager(config)

        with webdriver.Chrome(options=anti_detection.get_chrome_options()) as driver:  #Or other browser
            driver.get(config['target_url'])
            #Handle dynamic elements (infinite scroll, lazy loading etc. - example below)
            while True: #Example infinite scroll handling
                try:
                    #Find the load more button or element that triggers loading more data
                    load_more_button = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
                        EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.CSS_SELECTOR, config['load_more_selector']))
                    )
                    load_more_button.click()
                    random_delay(1, 3) # Wait for data to load
                except Exception as e:
                    logging.info(f"No more elements to load: {e}")
                    break

            html = driver.page_source
            data = extract_data(html, config)
            output_manager.save_data(data)
            logging.info("Scraping completed successfully.")

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with open('config.yaml', 'r') as file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(file)
    scrape_website(config)

```

**3. `config.yaml` (Configuration File):**

```yaml
target_url: "https://example.com/products" #Your target URL
output_format: "json"
output_file: "examples/sample_output.json"
proxies:
  type: "rotating" # "rotating" or "file"
  provider: "your_proxy_provider_details" #Details depend on provider
load_more_selector: "#load-more-button" #CSS selector for load more button (example)
user_agents:
  - "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
  - "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
# Add more configuration options as needed...
```

**4.  `proxies.py`, `anti_detection.py`, `data_extraction.py`, `output_manager.py`, `utils.py`:**  These modules would contain the respective implementations for proxy management, anti-detection techniques, data parsing, output handling, and helper functions.  They would need to be fleshed out based on the specific requirements and chosen methods.

**5. `README.md`:**  This file should include detailed instructions on setting up the project, configuring the scraper, running it, and troubleshooting common issues.  It should also include the license information (e.g., MIT License).


**Important Considerations:**

* **Ethical Scraping:** Always respect the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service. Avoid overloading the target website with requests.
* **Legal Compliance:** Ensure your scraping activities comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the code to catch and manage exceptions gracefully.
* **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components and the overall scraper.


This expanded outline provides a more realistic starting point for your project. Remember to fill in the missing parts of the code and adapt it to your specific needs and the target website's structure.  Always test thoroughly and respect website terms of service.  Consider using a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.  Remember to replace placeholder comments and values with your actual implementation details.
